	<h1>Why should you Let Out Thanks?</h1>

	<p>Let Out Thanks was created to give you an opportunity to tell those around you how much you appreciate them and what they've done in your life. There's so many times in life where we don't get a chance to tell someone in our life how much they mean to us until it is too late, whether that's because they move away or any other unfortunate circumstance. The goal of this site is to eliminate that.</p>

	<p>Your friends and family may know that you love them, but have you ever put it into words for them? Let's create some positive in the world together and show some appreciation.</p>
